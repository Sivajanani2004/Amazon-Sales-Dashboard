# Amazon-Sales-Dashboard
I created this Power BI project to analyze Amazon sales data. The main goal was to understand how different products perform and to get insights like total profit, order status, and top-selling categories.
### Tools I Used
* Power BI – to build the dashboard
* Python (Pandas) – to clean and prepare the data
* Amazon Sales Dataset – used for analysis
### What I Did in it
* Cleaned the raw data using Python
* Created visualizations in Power BI
* Added filters and charts to make it easy to explore the data
* Highlighted useful metrics like profit, courier status, and category-wise sales
### Challenges I Faced
* Some important columns like product name or selling price were missing in the dataset
* I had to decide the best visuals to clearly show insights without cluttering the dashboard
* Learned to balance design and functionality while building a dashboard
### How to View the Dashboard
1. Download the .pbix file
2. Open it in Power BI Desktop
3. Explore the visuals and filters
